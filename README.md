# AWS Edit in the Cloud

This step-by-step guide details how to deploy an edit host, storage, and connectivity on AWS. This template allows users to build additional features, and add functionality, into an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) deployment. By incorporating Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, you can utilize a central repository for your media assets while providing an easy connection to your EC2 instance. The template also includes AWS Directory Services in conjunction with Teradici for federated login to allow for seamless editorial experience. Once you are logged into AWS Management Console, use this AWS CloudFormation deployment template.

## Building distributable for customization

* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket

```sh
export SOLUTION_NAME=aws-edit-in-the-cloud
export VERSION=v1.0.1
export BUCKET_PREFIX=my_s3_bucket # change this variable to the basename of your S3 bucket
export REGION_TO_TEST=us-west-2 # change this variable to the region of your S3 bucket
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=$BUCKET_PREFIX
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=$BUCKET_PREFIX
export BUILD_OUTPUT_BUCKET=$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION_TO_TEST
export CFN_TEMPLATE="aws-edit-in-the-cloud.template"
```

_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix 'my_s3_bucket-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

* Now build the distributable:

```sh
cd deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET
```

> **Notes**: The _build-s3-dist_ script expects two S3 buckets as input parameters: one for the global assets, and one for regional assets. 

Ensure that you are owner of the AWS S3 buckets passed to the build-s3-dist.sh script:

```
aws s3api head-bucket --bucket $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET --expected-bucket-owner YOUR-AWS-ACCOUNT-NUMBER
aws s3api head-bucket --bucket $BUILD_OUTPUT_BUCKET --expected-bucket-owner YOUR-AWS-ACCOUNT-NUMBER
```

* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. 

```sh
aws s3 cp global-s3-assets/  s3://$TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
aws s3 cp regional-s3-assets/ s3://$BUILD_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
```

* Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.

```sh
echo "https://s3.amazonaws.com/$TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/$CFN_TEMPLATE"
```

* Deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.
